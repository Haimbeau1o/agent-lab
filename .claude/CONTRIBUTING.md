## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/adong-vibecoding.git
cd adong-vibecoding
```

### 2. Create a branch

```bash
git checkout -b add-python-reviewer
```

### 3. Add your contribution

Place files in the appropriate directory:
- `agents/` for new agents
- `skills/` for skills (can be single .md or directory)
- `commands/` for slash commands
- `rules/` for rule files
- `hooks/` for hook configurations
- `mcp-configs/` for MCP server configs

### 4. Follow the format

**Agents** should have frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: What it does
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
model: sonnet
---

Instructions here...
```

**Skills** should be clear and actionable:

```markdown
# Skill Name

## When to Use

...

## How It Works

...

## Examples

...
```

**Commands** should explain what they do:

```markdown
---
description: Brief description of command
---

# Command Name

Detailed instructions...
```

**Hooks** should include descriptions:

```json
{
  "matcher": "...",
  "hooks": [...],
  "description": "What this hook does"
}
```

### 5. Test your contribution

Make sure your config works with Claude Code before submitting.

### 6. Submit a PR

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Python code reviewer agent"
git push origin add-python-reviewer
```

Then open a PR with:
- What you added
- Why it's useful
- How you tested it

---

## Guidelines

### Do

- Keep configs focused and modular
- Include clear descriptions
- Test before submitting
- Follow existing patterns
- Document any dependencies

### Don't

- Include sensitive data (API keys, tokens, paths)
- Add overly complex or niche configs
- Submit untested configs
- Create duplicate functionality
- Add configs that require specific paid services without alternatives

---

## File Naming

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `python-reviewer.md`
- Be descriptive: `tdd-workflow.md` not `workflow.md`
- Match the agent/skill name to the filename
